**What is easiest first thing you can do that can be useful when you do not have a structure in life and you want to improve to be partial structural lifestyle?**

One of the easiest first steps you can take towards developing a more structured lifestyle is to create a daily routine. Having a routine can help you establish a sense of structure and predictability in your day, which can make it easier to prioritise your tasks and manage your time more effectively. Here are a few tips for creating a daily routine:

1. Start with a simple routine: Don't try to create an elaborate routine right away. Instead, start with a few simple habits that you can do consistently each day. For example, you might start with a morning routine that includes waking up at the same time each day, drinking a glass of water, and doing a short meditation or stretching routine.
2. Block out time for important tasks: Identify the most important tasks you need to accomplish each day and block out specific times on your calendar to work on them. This can help you stay focused and avoid getting distracted by other tasks or activities.
3. Build in breaks: It's important to build in breaks throughout your day to help you recharge and stay focused. This might include taking a short walk outside, doing a quick workout, or simply taking a few deep breaths.
4. Be flexible: Remember that life is unpredictable, and it's important to be flexible and adaptable in your routine. Don't be afraid to adjust your routine as needed to accommodate changes in your schedule or unexpected events.

By creating a simple daily routine and gradually building on it over time, you can develop a more structured lifestyle that supports your goals and priorities.

**What happens when you know you have to it, but you don't feel like doing it? How can you provide immediate gratification so that mind does what you want to do ?**

When you know you have to do something, but you don't feel like doing it, it can be challenging to find the motivation to take action. Here are a few strategies that can help you provide immediate gratification and overcome this challenge:

1. Break the task down into smaller steps: Sometimes a task can feel overwhelming, and this can make it hard to get started. Try breaking the task down into smaller, more manageable steps. This can help you feel like you're making progress and provide a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.
2. Use a timer: Set a timer for a specific amount of time, such as 25 minutes, and focus solely on the task during that time. Once the timer goes off, take a short break before setting the timer again for another focused work session. This can help you stay motivated and avoid getting distracted by other tasks or activities.
3. Reward yourself: Give yourself a small reward for completing the task. This could be something as simple as taking a break to enjoy a cup of coffee or going for a short walk outside. By providing immediate gratification, you can reinforce the behaviour of taking action even when you don't feel like it.
4. Visualise the outcome: Take a few minutes to visualise the outcome of completing the task. This can help you feel more motivated and excited about taking action, even if you don't feel like it in the moment.

Remember, it's important to be kind to yourself and recognise that sometimes you just won't feel like doing something. By using these strategies to provide immediate gratification and overcome resistance, you can increase your chances of taking action even when motivation is low.
