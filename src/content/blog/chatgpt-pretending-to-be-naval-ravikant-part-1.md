I asked ChatGPT to pretend like Naval Ravikant, this part is related to information overload, take actions on your collected information and doing things when you donâ€™t feel like it.

Lets dive in.

**How to stop consuming information every time and put into a action what you have collected and don't doubt again all the things you have already figured out?**

- One effective way to stop consuming information without taking action is to set specific goals and deadlines for yourself. Instead of simply consuming information without a clear purpose, think about what you want to achieve and what steps you need to take to get there. Then, set specific goals and deadlines for yourself, and hold yourself accountable for meeting them
- Another important aspect is to build a bias towards action. This means that whenever you encounter a new piece of information, you should immediately think about how you can apply it to your life and take action on it. Don't wait for the perfect plan or the perfect moment, just start taking small steps towards your goals
- Finally, it's important to develop a strong sense of self-confidence and trust in your own abilities. Doubt and indecision can often arise when we lack confidence in our own abilities or are unclear about our goals. By focusing on your strengths, building your skills, and staying true to your values, you can develop a sense of clarity and confidence that will allow you to take action without hesitation

**What if the information has a chance to be useful but not able to action it out right away, what is the best way to keep schedule to come back later to it?**

If you come across information that you believe could be useful, but you're not able to take action on it right away, one strategy is to create a system for organising and prioritising that information. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Create a to-do list or task manager: Use a to-do list or task manager to keep track of the information you want to act on later. When you come across something you want to follow up on, add it to your list with a due date or deadline.
2. Use a note-taking app: Use a note-taking app to capture and organise the information you come across. Many note-taking apps allow you to tag and categorise your notes, making it easy to find what you need later.
3. Set reminders: Use your phone or computer to set reminders for yourself to follow up on the information at a later date. This can be especially helpful if the information is time-sensitive or if you have a lot of other tasks competing for your attention.
4. Schedule time to review: Set aside time on a regular basis (e.g. weekly or monthly) to review the information you've collected and decide what to act on next. This can help you stay organised and ensure that you don't miss any important opportunities.

Overall, the key is to develop a system that works for you and to be consistent in using it. By taking the time to organise and prioritise the information you come across, you can increase the chances that you'll be able to take action on it in the future.

**Information overload is a real problem and this quick dopamine of keep collecting useful things and not taking actual action against it, how to do you develop mindset to stop behaving like this and do action ?**

Developing a mindset to overcome information overload and take action can be challenging, but there are a few strategies that may be helpful:

1. Set clear goals and priorities: One of the reasons we get caught up in collecting information is that we're not clear on what we want to achieve. By setting clear goals and priorities, you can focus your attention on the information that is most relevant and actionable.
2. Create a plan of action: Once you have clear goals and priorities, create a plan of action that outlines the specific steps you need to take to achieve those goals. This can help you stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked by information that is not directly relevant to your objectives.
3. Set boundaries: Information overload can be exacerbated by the constant stream of notifications and distractions that come from our phones, computers, and other devices. Consider setting boundaries around your use of technology, such as turning off notifications during certain times of the day, or setting aside specific times for checking email or social media.
4. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, can help you stay present and focused in the moment. By practicing mindfulness, you can become more aware of when you're getting distracted by information overload, and better able to refocus your attention on taking action.
5. Take imperfect action: Finally, remember that taking imperfect action is better than taking no action at all. Don't wait for the perfect plan or the perfect moment, just start taking small steps towards your goals. By doing so, you can build momentum and gain confidence in your ability to take action, which can help you overcome information overload and achieve your objectives.
